Transfer Learning Based Deep Features for Diagnosis of Down Syndrome in Children Using Facial Images 🧠👶📸
About the Project
This project presents a deep learning and ensemble-based diagnostic system for early detection of Down Syndrome using facial images. We utilize MobileNet for efficient feature extraction 🚀 and a Stacking Ensemble (SVM, Random Forest, KNN) 🎯 for robust classification.
The solution is lightweight, non-invasive, scalable, and validated using k-Fold Cross-Validation ✅.
